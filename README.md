# Single Layer Perceptron Algorithm/Animation

Percept.R contains an implimentation of the basic perceptron algorithm, which learns by increasing the weight vector by an amount proportional to a
randomly chosen misclassified point. In this case, the proportionality constant was set to 1, but the performance may have been improved by lessening the sensitivity. 
As you can see in the gif file, the blue line (which approximates the red line) quickly gets "close" to the target, but then makes many (many...) small errors by overcompensating.
